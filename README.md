cookiecutter-cl
===============
A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for Common Lisp projects

Forked from [cookiecutter-cl](https://github.com/hbristow/cookiecutter-cl).



Features
--------

- Canonical Common Lisp project structure
- ASDF system definitions
- Run project from sources
- Build a binary
- Choose your Lisp implementation
- Test suite using [lisp-unit](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/readings/lisp-unit.html) and CI using [travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
- Standardized use of string designators
- BSD licenced by default


Usage
-----

Create a new project. You'll be prompted to provide some basic
information about your new project, which will then be auto-generated
in the current working directory:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/vindarel/cl-cookieproject
project_name [cookie-lisp-project]:
repo_name [cookie-lisp-project]:
description []: A test project
version [0.0.1]:
year [1984]:
author [CL User]: me
email [me@mail.com]:
username [mme]:
branch [master]:
remote [origin]:
Initialised empty Git repository in /home/vince/bacasable/lisp-projects/cookie-lisp-project/.git/
Switched to a new branch 'master'
```

Run it straight away:

```bash
$ cd cookie-lisp-project
$ make run
rlwrap sbcl --load run.lisp
This is SBCL 2.0.10, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

Hello from cookie-lisp-project!

You can see the `Hello` from the `main` function, and we are given a Lisp REPL.

```bash
$ make build
