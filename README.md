# cl-cookieproject

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for Common
Lisp projects. Very opinionated towards my own use. Comes with a bit of
[Nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) scaffolding.

Check out the original from
[vindarel](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-cookieproject/) instead.


## Usage

You will need:
- cookiecutter
